|   NumberPrinter.java  |   Iteration  | The program outputs a descending pattern where each row displays a decreasing number of identical values, starting from 10 down to 1.                                                                                                                        |
|     Rectangle.java    |     Class    | This class was created in order to store information over rectangles and highlights all the fundamental parts of a class. Including variables, parameters, getter and setter methods, and a toString method.                                                 |
|      Reverse.java     |   Recursion  | This is a simple program that reverses a string using recursion.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| TemperatureMonth.java |   2d Array   | The TemperatureMonth class stores temperature data for a month, and traverses 2d arrays to retrieve the highest and lowest temperatures for each week, determine the overall temperature range for the month, and access the temperature for a specific day. |
|   binarySearch.java   |   Algorithm  | This is a simple binary search algorithm that returns the index of a number in a given array of integers.                                                                                                                                                    |
